# BATTERY HEALTH AND CHARGING ESTIMATOR.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT - 
Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is growing rapidly, but battery performance concerns remain a significant barrier for many potential buyers. 
Two critical pain points for EV owners and manufacturers are:
1.Battery Degradatioon
2.Charging Time

## SOLUTION - 
A ML based Application which will 
1. Estimates battery degradation rate based on usage patterns
2. Predicts accurate charging time considering battery health & conditions
3. Web-based interface for easy input
   
## TECH STACK - 
   Python , Numpy , Pandas , Scikitlearn , Flask , Adopted Frontend ( HTML , CSS ,JS).
